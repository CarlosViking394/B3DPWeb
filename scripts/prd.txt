# Brisbane 3D Printing Cost Estimator - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview
I'm building a single-page web app for https://brisbane3dprinting.com.au/print-my-model/. The goal is to let users upload 3D model files (STL or 3MF), preview the object in a 3D viewer, and get a **real-world print cost estimate**.

This replaces the static info currently on the page. It must match the visual style of the main site (soft shadows, clean white background, rounded cards, calm gray/blue/black palette). Responsive layout is important.

---

## ðŸ”§ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### 1. FILE UPLOAD
- Accept `.stl` and `.3mf` files
- Display filename, size, and basic dimensions

### 2. 3D PREVIEW
- Use **Three.js** (or `@react-three/fiber`) to render and allow manipulation (orbit, zoom) of the uploaded model
- Optional (future): integrate Bamboo Studio viewer or mimic its look

### 3. COST CALCULATION
- Base material types:
  - PLA: $25/kg
  - ABS: $30/kg
  - PETG: $35/kg
  - TPU: $45/kg
- Support "batch mode" and tiered pricing:
  - If `isBatch` is true, use hourly rate: $7/hr (normal), $10/hr (exotic materials)
  - If not batch, use:
    - <1h: $10â€“$15
    - 1â€“3h: $30â€“$45
    - 3â€“6h: $60â€“$90
    - 6â€“10h+: $100â€“$150
- Add costs for optional services:
  - Modelling: $70/hr
  - Support removal, painting, cleaning: $60/hr each
  - Support fractional hours (e.g. 1.5h)
- Estimate **print time** based on:
  - Volume (calculated from STL file)
  - Fixed print speed (60 mm/s)
  - Fixed layer height (0.2mm)
  - Optionally simulate extra time if support material required (based on overhangs)
- Enforce **minimum price** of $30

### 4. ETA CALCULATION
- Get user's coordinates via **browser Geolocation API**
- Calculate distance from user to printing center:
  - Brisbane: latitude: -27.4698, longitude: 153.0251
- Assume:
  - 50 km/day shipping
  - Print time converted from hours to days
  - +1 extra day for prep
  - +0.5â€“1.5 random delay for production queue

### 5. DESIGN SYSTEM
- Match look/feel of brisbane3dprinting.com.au
  - Use existing font, colors, and button styles
  - Card-like layout with clean spacing and shadows
- Show:
  - Uploaded file info
  - Material selector (highlight selected)
  - Optional services with steppers
  - Estimated print time, ETA, and total cost
- Make it **responsive**

## ðŸ§© TECH SETUP
Use modern React + TypeScript. No backend for now.

Use any of:
- `@react-three/fiber` + `@react-three/drei`
- `three-mesh-bvh` or `stl-volume` to parse STL and get volume
- `tailwindcss` or inline styles (but match site's design)

## âœ… TODOs

Please:
1. Set up file upload and STL parsing
2. Render uploaded file in 3D with camera controls
3. Add cost calculation logic with helper functions
4. Add optional service selectors and hours input
5. Show print time and shipping ETA
6. Style with responsive, site-matching layout
7. Keep logic modular and scalable

You may create helper components (`CostEstimator`, `ModelViewer`, `OptionalServicesPanel`, etc.) as needed.

Let me know if you need a starting point or assets. The code can assume I will handle hosting and production config.
